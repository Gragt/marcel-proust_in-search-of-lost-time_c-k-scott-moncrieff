			<p>To MRS. H ____, on her Birthday</p>
			<p>Oberon, in the Athenian glade, Reduced by deft Titania’s power, Invented arts for Nature’s aid And from a snowflake shaped a flower: Nature, to outdo him, wrought of human clay A fairy blossom, which we acclaim to-day.</p>
			<p>Hebe, to high Olympus borne, Undoomed to death, by age uncurst, Xeres and Porto, night and morn, Let flow, to appease celestial thirst: Ev’n so, untouched by years that envious pass Youth greets the guests to-night and fills the glass.</p>
			<p>Hesione, for monstrous feast, Against a rock was chained, to die; Young Hercles came, he slew the beast, Nor won the award of chivalry: E.S.P.H., whom monsters hold in awe, Shield thee from injury, and enforce the law!</p>
			<p>C. K. S. M.</p>
